<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViniciusmDias/quote-generator/main/public/quote-generator-demo.png)

To solve this challenge I used Next.js with Typescript, using the create-next-app template.
I used styled components to style the application and I created a test to check if the page is rendered.
This application is hosted on Netlify.
